# Traffic-Citations-Wichita-2015-2020

For this project, the data was taken from [ICT OpenData Portal](https://ict-opendata-cityofwichita.hub.arcgis.com/search?q=citations). The traffic citation data used in this analysis includes all records for 2015-2020. Data Exploration was performed on the dataset to understand the patterns. 

## Conclusion

- Overall, the number of citations issued in Wichita has decreased significantly, from 70,000 in 2015 to 42,000 in 2020. Although, there is a slight increase in the number of citations issued from 2019 to 2020.
- Chevrolet and Ford drivers received the highest number of citations in Wichita. This is also because these are 2 are the most popular car brands in Wichita. Toyota and Honda fall at 3rd and 4th spot respectively.
- The most committed traffic violation is the "SPEED OVER LIMIT". The 2nd and 3rd most committed violations are "NO PROOF OF INSURANCE" and "DR ON SUSP/REV/CANC/FRAUD DL" (Driving on Suspended/Revoked/Cancelled/Fraud Driver's License). "SPEED OVER LIMIT" violation was committed approximately 3 times more than the "NO PROOF OF INSURANCE" violation.
- Most drivers that received citations belonged to the age group of 20 - 24. Violators who belonged to the age group of 15 and below received the lowest number of citations. A general trend is that people in the high age group received less traffic citations than people in the low age group in any given year. This could be due to the two possible reasons:
    - Growing number of young drivers in the city
    - People in the high age group have more driving experience.
- The general trend for the "SPEED OVER LIMIT" violation is that as we move from low age group to a higher age group, the number of times this violation was issued decreases.
- The maximum number of citations (~7,162) ever issued was in March 2015. We do some seasonality in the plot for Year VS Month.
- In general, the number of citations issued increases in March and August. For the year 2020, we see a sharp decrease in the citations issued from Jan to April. This is very likely due to Covid 19 pandemic as most of the places either closed temporarily or switched to work from home. Another thing worth noting is that number of citations issued decreases in March, and October for any given year.
- Typically, the number of citations issued is high on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The general trend is that the citations issued increases from Monday to Thursday and then decreases all the way till Sunday. For any given year and month, the citations issued is lowest on sundays.
- Talking about the different violations and their disposition, it was found that most of the accused drivers were found guilty for the citations related to wearing seat belts and driving on expired/fraud/canceled licences. Most of the cases were eventually dismissed for the citations related to "NO PROOF OF INSURANCE".
- In the double-layered donut chart, we see the top 5 hours of the day of each of the top 4 locations where the maximum number of citations were issued. It is very prominent that most number of citations were issued on 455 N Main Street at 9 AM. The most intriguing part is that the top 5 times for E 13th Street N and E Harry Street is the same. For E KELLOGG DR, E 13TH ST N, and E HARRY ST, it appears that most of the citations were issued in the evening.
